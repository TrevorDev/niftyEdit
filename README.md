- Make apps webpages
- Create the best dev environment for typescript, node and web apps
- Remove the need for long "compiling" when developing apps
- Make apps like atom editor startup as quickly as making a new tab
- Merge browser tabs with taskbar icons
- Have a faster startup than mainstream os's
- Experiment with new user interfaces

install archlinux in virtual box
https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/arch-linux-installation-with-xfce-desktop/
install nodejs, npm
install xorg gedit xterm
virtualbox sux so xorg needs a bunch of config
install Guest additions disc when using virtualbox
try:
X -configure
X
the above gave me blank screen
try running
xinit gedit
this should open gedit as its own fullscreen app

npm install electron-prebuilt -g
electron requires
gconf
libnotify
gtk2
nss
alsa-lib

touch ~/.xinitrc
edit that file to add
electron main.js
cd into folder with main.js (electron entry point)
run: xinit
interface has been launched
```
